Welcome to the Libft Project! This project is designed to understand and implement essential functions from the standard C library. By creating my own library, libft, I obtained a deeper understanding of how these functions work.

The objective is to create a comprehensive library of functions that replicate standard C library functions and extend functionality with additional useful routines. This is intended to serve as a foundation for subsequent C programming projects, ensuring reliable set of tools.

These functions must have the same prototypes and behaviors as the originals, but with the prefix ft_. 

In addition to the libc functions, I also develop a set of additional functions that are not part of the standard C library or are implemented differently.

Program Requirements

    Library Name: libft.a
    Turn-in Files: Makefile, libft.h, ft_*.c
    Makefile Rules: NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
    External Functions: None authorized
    Libft Authorized: Not applicable

Technical Considerations

    Global Variables: Declaring global variables is forbidden.
    Helper Functions: Define helper functions as static functions to limit their scope to the appropriate file.
    File Placement: Place all files at the root of your repository.
    Unused Files: Turning in unused files is forbidden.
    Compilation Flags: Every .c file must compile with the flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
    Library Creation: Use the ar command to create your library. The libtool command is forbidden.
    Library Location: Your libft.a must be created at the root of your repository.
